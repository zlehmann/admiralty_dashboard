Flatiron Rails Final Project!

For my Rails and Javascript final project I built a video game companion app to help players manage their captains, ships, and the actions those ships participated in. The app was built on rails using some javascript to reduce renders and improve user experience. The app also utilizes GitHub authentication through OAuth. Users are able to create, edit, or delete captains, ships, and actions.
